Greeting. This project was created thanks to an idea that came to me while working on an exam assignment for the course "Fundamentals of Management."

This repository contains a program for a simple yet unusual calculator. It is designed for three functions: Ranking materials using ABC analysis, creating a Lorenz curve based on ABC analysis data, and calculating the probability of firm bankruptcy. As of the current date, 7/24/2024, files with the main code have been pushed, including a .gitignore file with the virtual environment and a requirements.txt file specifying the libraries needed for the project.

The first version of the application is quite raw; updates and new features will be added soon.

Thank you for your attention, and see you soon!

Postscript: I wish you a good time of day :) Develop in the direction that suits you and move towards your goals :) Good luck; it is always with you!
